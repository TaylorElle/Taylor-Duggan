    <h1> About Taylor </h1>
      <p> After graduating college with a Psychology degree, I spent several years working in the non-profit sector. 
      Enjoying the growth and experience that was provided through the various responsibilities I had, I eventually wanted a new challenge in a different sector. <p>
      <p> Software engineering has been a dream of mine for the past several years and I am overjoyed at the opportunity to study with <a href= "https://www.thinkful.com/" target = "_blank">Thinkful</a>. </p>
      <p> If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out! My experience and gained wisdom from the non-profit world mixed with my knowledge of software engineering is just what you need for your next project. </p>
